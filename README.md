NETFLIX MOVIE RECOMMENDATION

In this project,We will look into how to implement movie suggestions to the user based on What kind of genre and taste the user is favourable to. Through this project we seek to unveil the inner workings and intricacies of the acclaimed recommendation algorithm that drives one of the world's most popular streaming platforms. This project delves deep into the world of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, aiming to dissect the algorithms and methodologies that power Netflix's ability to suggest tailored content to its millions of users worldwide.

Data Preprocessing: The first and foremost step of this project is to process the data extracted and collected through the dataset.We start by importing the necessary libraries, handling missing data, and encoding categorical data. This ensures that the data we work with is clean, organised, and ready for analysis. In these videos, you'll learn the intricate details of each of these preprocessing tasks.

Feature Scaling: Once the data is preprocessed, we delve into Feature Scaling, a method that standardises the range of independent variables. This essential step guarantees that our machine learning algorithms can work effectively and make accurate predictions

Apriori and ECLAT: These two algorithms are used in this project for better analysis and prediction. Apriori Algorithm uses the Apriori property to iteratively expand frequent itemsets by joining previously found frequent itemsets. ECLAT (Equivalence Class Transformation) is a depth-first search (DFS) approach.Uses vertical data representation to find frequent itemsets by intersecting transaction ID lists. Apriori is introduced in two parts, where we explore the theory behind it and delve into its implementation. You'll gain insights into how Apriori identifies associations between different movies, paving the way for personalised recommendations. Additionally, the ECLAT module offers an alternative approach, providing a comprehensive understanding of different recommendation techniques..
